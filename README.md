# LMStudio Chat App

LMStudio is a SwiftUI-based chat application that allows users to create, manage, and participate in chat sessions. The app supports multiple chat threads and persists chat messages using a local storage mechanism.

## Features
- **Multi-chat support**: Users can create and switch between multiple chat sessions.
- **Local chat history**: Messages are saved and loaded automatically.
- **Cross-platform UI**: Supports macOS and iOS with adaptive navigation views.
- **Modern SwiftUI design**: Uses SwiftUI components like `NavigationSplitView`, `TabView`, and `Picker`.

## Requirements
- macOS 12+ or iOS 15+
- Xcode 14+
- Swift 5+

## Installation and Setup
### Clone the Repository
```sh
 git clone <repository-url>
 cd LMStudio
```

### Open in Xcode
1. Launch **Xcode**.
2. Select **File > Open** and navigate to the `LMStudio` folder.
3. Open the project and wait for dependencies to resolve.

### Build and Run
1. Select the target device (iPhone, iPad, or Mac).
2. Click **Run** (`âŒ˜R`).

## Project Structure
- **LMStudioApp.swift**: The main entry point of the app.
- **ContentView.swift**: Handles navigation between chat and settings.
- **ChatView.swift**: Displays chat messages and allows users to create/select conversations.
- **ChatLogManager.swift**: Manages storage and retrieval of chat messages.
- **SettingsView.swift**: Contains user-configurable settings.

## Settings Explained

The Settings section in LMStudio allows you to configure the following:
- API Settings
- API URL: Specify the endpoint that the app will use to connect with the backend server. By default, it is set to https://10.0.0.10:1234.
- Model Settings
- Model Picker: Choose from a list of available models that the app can use. This list is loaded dynamically by pressing the refresh button (ðŸ”„).
- Temperature: Adjust the creativity of the modelâ€™s responses. The value ranges from 0.0 (more deterministic) to 2.0 (more creative), with a default of 0.8.
- Max Tokens: Set the maximum number of tokens (words or word pieces) the model can generate in a response. The slider allows you to choose a value between 32 and 8192, with a default value of 512.

These settings let you customize the behavior of the chat AI, from its connection endpoint to the style and length of generated responses.

Iâ€™ve added a new section in the README that explains the settings in detail. Here is the updated version:
